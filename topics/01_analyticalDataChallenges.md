# What is analytical data?

Original of analytical data (e.g., chemical, physical, biological data) and its significance in various fields.
Analytical data awareness (e.g., variety of analytical instruments and detection methods).

Analytical data refers to data generated from various analytical techniques used to measure, analyze, and interpret the properties of substances or phenomena. This includes chemical, physical, and biological data obtained through methods such as spectroscopy, chromatography, microscopy, and sensor technologies. Analytical data is significant across multiple fields including environmental science, food safety, pharmaceuticals, and materials science.
